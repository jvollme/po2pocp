## po2pocp.py
Calculates pairwise [pocp][] values from [proteinortho5][] results.

Input should be the "*.proteinortho* file, listing orthologeous groups shared by comparison strains, generated by proteinortho5.
Result is a matrix of pairwise [pocp][] values for each combination of comparison strains, in tab-delimited text format. This matrix can be used to test or define meberships to bacterial genera, as proposed by [Qin et al (2014)]

usage: ```po2pocp -i <input.proteinortho> \[-o output.table\]```

This tool was originally created for lab-internal use and not with user friendliness or adaptiveness in mind. It is published here, to enable reproducability of any of our research projects that may have been using this script.

More flexible versions may be uploaded whenever I have time for it. For any problems or questions about the usage, please create an Issue on this repository.
